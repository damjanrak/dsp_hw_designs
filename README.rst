Hardware accelerators for DSP algorithms - novel hardware design approach PyGears
=================================================================================


I will go through hardware implementation of numerous accelerators targeting mostly DSP algorithms. This blog will try to explain power of new hw design methodology incorporated in **PyGears**.

For more about **PyGears** methodology, checkout `PyGears webpage <https://www.pygears.org/>`_.

Directory organization at the highest level of repository represents projects. Beside projects there is utils directory which will contain all necessary libraries for DSP algorithms which are universal and shared between projects.
