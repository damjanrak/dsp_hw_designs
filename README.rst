PyGears DSP library
===================

This repository represent library consist of hardware accelerators for DSP algorithms written in **PyGears**. **PyGears** is novel approach in hardware design based on functional paradigm. As this is imagined as library my focus is not on **PyGears** but more on implementation details.

For more about PyGears methodology, checkout `PyGears webpage <https://www.pygears.org/>`_.

Library organization
--------------------

At starting level you can find subdirectories:

- pg_dsp
- tests
- examples

**pg_dsp** represent implementation of hardware modules separated in subdirectories. 

**test** directory contain tests for library modules.

In **examples** directory you can find examples for algorithms which output could be catched by human senses.
