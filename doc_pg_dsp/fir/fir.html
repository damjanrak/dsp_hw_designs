<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>FIR systems are commonly used for digital signal processing. They can do
signal filtration when used as filters or discrete convolution. Also
they are used for reverberation.</p>
<p>As name says FIR system has impulse response of finite durations. That
means if we drive discrete delta impulse at FIR input its respons will
setls down to zero in finite time. Discrete delta impuls can be written
as:</p>
<div class="math">
<p><img src="../../_images/math/c7e2716b27b54b5b9c2a635c3ea28f2efacbf927.png" alt="\begin{aligned}
    \delta(n) =
    \left\{
        \begin{array}{ll}
            1 &amp; \mbox{if } n = 0 \\
            0 &amp; \mbox{if } n \neq 0
        \end{array}
    \right.     \end{aligned}"/></p>
</div><p>Mathematical record of finite respons on delta impulse should looks
like:</p>
<div class="math">
<p><img src="../../_images/math/45f7717cd651cae0af47800eb2d95928fce4ebf1.png" alt="\begin{aligned}
    g(n) =
    \left\{
        \begin{array}{ll}
            b_n &amp; \mbox{if } 0 \leq n \leq M \\
            0, &amp; \mbox{if } n &gt; M
        \end{array}
    \right.\end{aligned}"/></p>
</div><p>where b<sub>n</sub> represents impulse response in particular time step n,
and M is response length. Output equation of FIR systems can be written
as:</p>
<div class="math">
<p><img src="../../_images/math/4071957881cf493f8518a3cd9203dabf247cb7c5.png" alt="\label{eq:FIR output equation}
y(n) = \sum_{i=0}^{n}{b_{i} \cdot u(n-i)}"/></p>
</div><p>Having all that in mind one possible implementation of system with
output equation like 3 is shown in figure 1.</p>
<p>Translation of building blocks in figure 1 to digital hardware is
straightforward. Just replace adding block with adder, gain block with
multiplier, and delay block (E<sup>-1</sup>) with register. One possible
implementation could be to copy block diagrame directly to some HDL code
but that would not be general enough. We suggest another one shown in
figure 2. As we can see, there is a memory storage for coefficients, and
multiply accumulate unit that do summation from equation 3. Data from
input named coefficients is loaded to memory before computating 3. After
loading surrounding hardware should start streaming data samples through
samples interface. Connection from samples bus to coef memory is here
just to indicate that we need mechanism to synchronize input samples
with appropriate coefficient from memory. Later we will show how to do
that efficiently using <strong>PyGears</strong>.</p>
<p>Let’s go back to the figure 1. Beside it will be slow in terms of
frequency because of long combinational path, it will not be optimal
regarding silicon needed for implementation. It will use M+1 multipliers
and M adders. Because of that, we implement hardware that calculate FIR
output sequentially. First, delay registers were removed outside the
hardware block assuming that some other component will drive input
sequence correctly. That means that current input sample and delayed
ones will be driven as stream. If we look at equation 3 this stream is
represented by <img class="math" src="../../_images/math/2a0b93d1399b30d23fb2d700bbfcc3e43c8b9c5a.png" alt="u(n-i)"/> part which sould be multiplied with
appropriate coefficient b<sub>i</sub>. Because FIR coefficient will be
used over and over again a decision is made to store coefficient in
memory module inside the hardware. Another reason for such
implementation is caused by idea to make hardware reusable for more
general mathematical operation behind the equation 3 called convolution
because order of samples could vary.</p>

<h2>FIR API<a class="headerlink" href="#fir-api" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Function named fir represent whole design. It has two inputs, one for
coefficients and other for samples. Beside inputs it has two parameters,
shamt and coefficient depth. Its output is queue of integers with same
width as input samples.</p>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Coefs type is queue of integers. As name says this input serves to
receive all coefficients of FIR system.</p>
<p>Samples input is also queue of integers but it is second order queue.
This means that samples are treated as queue of queues where inner queue
correspond to one window needed for calculation of one output sample.
For example, in audio filtration this window of samples represents
current sample plus filter order number of previous samples. In 2D
convolution in CNNs this window is actually part of input feature map
which has shape same as kernel (FIR coefficients). Outer queue
correspond to end of input sequence. In audio filtration that can be end
of song, while in 2D convolution that is end of input feature map.</p>
<p>Shamt parameter is shift amount for resulting output. This is necessary
if we want to keep nunmber format same after FIR processing. Number is
extended because of multiplication opperation.</p>
<p>Coefficient depth correspond to coefficient memory depth. As an example,
in audio filtration this number represent max filter order that hardware
support.</p>

<p>Interesting parameters for our application are write port, read port and
depth. Write port is of type <em>Tuple(address, data)</em> while read port is
just address.</p>
<p>Because coefficients interface does not contain address, hardware will
create address internally. In this application address values have
regular increasing order from 0 to coefficient num. For address we use
module named <em>qcnt</em>. This module receive coefficient form input and
counts it. At the output it serves number that correspond to coefficient
possition in input queue which is equal to address in local memory.
Because <em>qcnt</em> output is queue of all this addresses (for example, if
filter has 3 coefficient output of <em>qcnt</em> will looks like [0, 1, 2]) and
<em>sdp</em> expects just <em>Tuple(address, data)</em> we needed to cast queue to
data which is done by <em>project</em> module. <em>Project</em> takes queue at its
input and reduce queue level (default reduction is 1 level). Now
addresses are created and we need to project coefs input because its
type is also queue and concatenate address with coefficient. Finally, we
get input Tuple for write port of <em>sdp</em>. Code below is responsible for
the described process.</p>

<p>To execute FIR opperation we must multiply every sample from input
window with corresponding coefficient and accumulate all these
multiplication results. For next output sample process is repeated with
new input sample. That means hardware should reuse coefficients again
and again. What is important for us is that order of coefficient neede
for multiplication is regular and starts from 0 to coefficient num.
Practically speaking we need read address generator that create
addresses starting from 0 to coefficient num. In order to realize this
we must count coefficients and that would be done while writing
coefficient to local memory. Modul named <em>qlen cnt</em> will receive
coefficient on its input and counts queue length. At the end of queue it
serves results which is stored in register. This is done in lines below.</p>
<div class="code python highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">coefs_num</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">coefs</span> \
            <span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">qlen_cnt</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">cnt_lvl</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span> \
            <span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">dreg</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To start FIR opperation we need sequence of read addresses in regular
order as mentioned. Additionally, we need this sequence for every output
sample. Because sequence should be triggered at the beggining of new
input window, samples input is passed to <em>queuenvelope</em> module which
takes subqueue (one window) and produce one output for every input
window. Its output will be only information about highest order queue
state which will tell us if current window is last window or it isn’t.
This information is not currently important but it is used to finaly
consume information about coefficients num stored in <em>dreg</em>. At the end
of input sequence, dreg result is pulled and FIR module is ready to
receive new coefficients. Speaking at lower level of abstraction,
<em>ready</em> signal is passed to <em>dreg</em> with last window in input sequence
because of <em>cart</em> module nature. As mentioned <em>queuenvelope</em> output is
brought to cartezian module (<em>cart</em>) which concatenates previously
calculated coefs num with this trigger. That means that we will get one
coefs num per every input window (subqueue). This information is needed
for range generator that will interpret it as upper limit of counting.
Range generator (<em>rng</em>) module receive command of type <em>Tuple(start,
end, increment)</em>. To prepare configuration we will concatenate constant
zero (<em>const(val=0)</em>) as beggining, dot pruduct len which is upper limit
calculated previously, and constant one for increment. This
configuration is passed to <em>rng</em> which outputs read address sequence.</p>

<p>Now, we have prepared read and write ports for memory so next line will
create memory module and connect it.</p>

<p>Next, we need MAC modul which will take samples and coefficient,
multiply them and accumulate. For this purpose we can use <strong>PyGears</strong>
built in modules named <em>add</em> and <em>mul</em>. However, targeted Xilinx
compiler is not capable of merging these two modules and mapping them to
on chip DSP block. Because of that custom gear <em>mac</em> is created. It is
written in pure <strong>SystemVerilog</strong> and can be found in
<em>utils/custom_gears/svlib/mac.sv</em>. Here is wrapper function used to
call this module.</p>
<div class="code python highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">TDin</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Queue</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">Tuple</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">Int</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;w_data&#39;</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="n">Int</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;w_data&#39;</span><span class="p">]]]</span>

<span class="nd">@gear</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">mac</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">din</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">TDin</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">Int</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="sa">b</span><span class="s1">&#39;2*w_data&#39;</span><span class="p">]:</span>
    <span class="k">pass</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>As it can be seen it receives two integers and produce output which has
len is twice wider than input integers. Because input samples are second
order queue and <em>mac</em> module receives queue we need to remove
information of the highest order queue from <em>mac</em> input. For this
purpose <em>fmap</em> can be used. In this particular application <em>fmap</em> is
used as some kind of wrapper that allow us to use <em>mac</em> module for the
input type for which it is not foreseen. That means <em>fmap</em> increase
reusability of general modules. Of course we could implement <em>mac</em>
module in that way that it can handle two input interfaces of different
type (queue of coefficients, and second order queue for input samples)
but that solution will create application specific <em>mac</em> module which
has less chance to be reused in other application. Beside reusability,
implemented <em>mac</em> was written with single responsibility idea on mind.
That means, it is more natural that <em>mac</em> receives two queues, do
multiply-add opperation and outputs result than to revceive second order
queue, queue, do multiply-add opperation, <strong>handle different queues
order</strong> and outputs results. In that case <em>mac</em> will have at least two
different functions to do which will reduce reusability. Having all
mentioned in mind, samples are piped into <em>fmap</em> and passed to <em>mac
wrap</em> wrapper function without information about the highest level of
queue. This is done by specifing <em>lvl=1</em> parameter in <em>fmap</em> call.
Beside passing samples, we pass shamt and coefficient for calc directly.
As you can see in mac wrap function samples are concatenated with
ceofficiens using <em>czip</em> module and passed to <em>mac</em>. <em>Mac</em> result is
shifted by shamt and casted to samples data type (dtype[0] means only
data type which is integer not queue). After doing multiply-add, result
is returned and the highest level of samples queue is concatenated to it
by <em>fmap</em>. Here is code that instantionate <em>mac</em> using wrapper function
mac wrap.</p>
