Examples
========

Here you can find examples that test implemented algorithms in the way that human senses could catch algorithm manifest. Examples are divided into subdirectories by name.

As instance, there is *fir* directory that contain example which create filter coefficients, and synthetic sound (sum of 3 sine signals) as filter input. Beside that, it quantizes both input and coefficient, create input sequences, and finally record filter input and output so you can check both and feel the difference.
